We are a group of non-Black quantum scientists and engineers invested in dismantling anti-Black racism in our field.
We welcome feedback on this action statement, especially from our Black and Indigenous scientist colleagues, whose leadership we have learned from and tried our best to follow in formulating our call to action.
